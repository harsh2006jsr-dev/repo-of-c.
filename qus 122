Q122: Write a C program that opens an existing file (e.g., info.txt) and reads its contents using fgets(). The program should print all the lines to the console until EOF (end of file) is reached.

/*
Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
File: info.txt (Content: Name: Rahul\nAge: 23)
Output 1:
Name: Rahul
Age: 23

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h> 
#define BUFFER_SIZE 256
int main() 
{
    FILE *filePointer;
    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
    const char *filename = "info.txt"; 
    filePointer = fopen(filename, "r");
    if (filePointer == NULL) 
    {
        printf("Error: Could not open the file **%s**. Please make sure it exists.\n", filename);
        return 1;
    }
    printf("--- Contents of %s ---\n", filename);
    while (fgets(buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, filePointer) != NULL) 
    {
        printf("%s", buffer);
