Q121: Write a C program that creates a text file named info.txt in write mode. The program should take the user’s name and age as input, and write them to the file using fprintf(). After writing, display a message confirming that the data was successfully saved.

/*
Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
Name: Rahul, Age: 23
Output 1:
File created successfully! Data written to info.txt

*/
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h> 
int main() 
{
    FILE *filePointer;
    char name[100];
    int age;
    filePointer = fopen("info.txt", "w");
    if (filePointer == NULL) 
    {
        printf("Error: Could not open the file info.txt\n");
        return 1;
    }
    printf("Enter your name: ");
    if (scanf("%99s", name) != 1)

        printf("Error reading name.\n");
        fclose(filePointer);
