Q102: Write a Program to take a sorted array arr[] and an integer x as input, find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x and print it. This element is called the ceil of x. If such an element does not exist, print -1. Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.

/*
Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
arr = [1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 5
Output 1:
2

Input 2:
arr = [1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 20
Output 2:
-1

Input 3:
arr = [1, 1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 0
Output 3:
0

Input 4:
arr = [1, 1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 2
Output 4:
2
